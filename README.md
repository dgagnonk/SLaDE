# SLaDE

## About
SLaDE: **S**ythe**L**ib **D**evelopment **E**nvironment

SLaDE is a development environment built around the C++ interpreted scripting language [ChaiScript](http://chaiscript.com/). It acts as a wrapper for SytheLib, an automation library built in C++. Its primary use-case is for automating tasks in games but it can be used for anything. Possible tasks include mouse and keyboard automation, as well as tasks based on bitmaps and colours (rudimentary computer vision).

SLaDE allows its users to develop scripts and run them contiguously, as would be expected from any modern IDE such as Visual Studio. SLaDE also comes with tools to make SytheLib script development easier, such as a colour and bitmap selector, a mouse coordinate display, an integrated console for input and output, a clip bin, window handle analyzer (called WinSiphon), with more on the horizon.

## Planned features
The most prominent feature on the horizon is a documentation browser. Autocomplete would also be a "nice to have" feature.
A couple of minor planned features include a better clip bin and a dark theme.
