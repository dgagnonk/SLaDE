# SLaDE

## About
SLaDE is a development environment built around the C++ interpreted scripting language [ChaiScript](http://chaiscript.com/). It works alongside the C++ interpreter dubbed SytheLib, which is a task automation engine built to automate various tasks on the desktop. It works best with games but can be used with anything. SLaDE itself consolidates the development process and allows the user to make scripts easily with different in-software tools like window handle selectors, bitmap to string translators, colour pickers, etc. As of the writing of this readme those tools are not yet in SLaDE, but they are coming.

## Planned features
SLaDE is still shy of a full release. Some planned features include completed syntax highlighting, autocomplete, improvements on the clip bin, and documentation for SytheLib's many functions. 

## Is this project usable?
Yes.
